## Selection Sorting Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of selection sort, a simple and efficient sorting algorithm.

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instructions or rules that guide the computer or software in performing a particular task or solving a problem 1.

## What is Selection Sorting Algorithm and How Does it Help Us?
Selection sort is an in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the list into two parts, the sorted part on the left and the unsorted part on the right . It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list .

Selection sort has several advantages over other sorting algorithms. It is simple to understand and implement, requires no additional memory space, and performs well on small lists . However, it is not suitable for large lists as its time complexity is O(nÂ²) .

## Usage
To use this project and see how it works to sort our numbers, we should type a number in the input field that reads `Enter your number` and click on the `Add Number` button to add our number to the basket of numbers that are not sorted (`your numbers` section). When you have typed all of your numbers and added them to the basket, click on the `Start Sorting` button. The result will appear in the `After Sorting` section, where you can see that your numbers are sorted!
